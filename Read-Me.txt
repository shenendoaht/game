This game is a personal project to reinforce knowledge and gain comfort writing various programming languages. 

It has gone through several iterations* and is finally at a place where I am comfortable sharing my progress.

The core languages used in this application are:
HTML5 
CSS
JavaScript

The HTML file is a single page with 'modal' sections that toggle visibilty based on user input. 
The CSS calls down multiple files, each targeting specific components of the application.
The JavaScript is modular, spanning across various files similar to the way components function in 'React'.

My design began with the FILE Architecture:
A single IMAGE folder to hold the images used.
A CSS folder to hold the CSS files.
A main JS file to hold all of the components:
  The various JS components: CHARACTERS, CHATS, ENEMIES, MINI GAMES, PAGES, UTIL.
  The ENEMIES folder branches into AMBUSH, BATTLEDOME, and INVASION: each targeting specific enemy interactions. 
Two main files {index.js and index.html} live in the main folder of the Application, along with 
the notes.md and Read-Me.txt files. 

The data lives in various JSON object files, though none is pushed to an 
API or handled with localStorage, sessionStorage etc.

While much can admittedly be improved with a design such as this I believe this serves as a fine example
as my creativity and ability with web-design and development. 

* I was prepared to publish a prior version of this game where most of the interactive elements used 
the html <button></button> tag - though I failed to account for button interactivity on mobile devices 
requiring a different event handler to fire the associated function. This latest version (while not something 
I would suggest in most cases) uses the html <a></a> tag to make each interactive element a 'link' with the
current page as the source ref.
